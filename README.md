This project sought to harmonise data on Lagos' ferry transportation into a comprehensive viewing platform. It includes maps of terminal locations and routes. 
It also contains information on trip schedules for selected routes. It was built using Plotly, Folium, and Streamlit. 
The data was obtained from Google Maps, and the websites of the Lagos Waterways Authority (LASWA) and Lagos Ferry Services company.

The dashboard can be viewed at https://lagosferrydata.streamlit.app/
